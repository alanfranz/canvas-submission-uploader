## Canvas Submission Uploader

A very simple submission script for [Instructure Canvas](https://www.canvaslms.com/).

I find it useful for multi-file submissions, where I always risk forgetting a piece of code that
I need to submit. As an [OMSCS](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) student, I find this VERY useful.

## Instructions

Steps:
* Pick an access token for canvas (Account -> Settings -> Approved integrations -> New Access Token)
* Just copy this template in each directory where you hold the files for an assignment
* Tweak the values at the beginning of the script, they're commented
* Run the script when you want to submit. Please note that this is designed to use Python3,
  and it's standalone (no need for virtual environments, etc, it will setup its dependencies
  automatically in an isolated way, so it won't mess with your system deps)

## Notes

This is an unofficial tool. I'm not affiliated with Instructure.
